borEDOC - CODErob -  broCODE
THE BORCODE - collection of codes you code when you code a code while coding other codes

beware of these "**thingies**" as some of them may not "work as expected", use at your own's risk

**Current "thingies"**

astu-edu-et-news-grab <=> grab the (not so) latest news from the astu.edu.et website

dd0s.py <=> a simple "random request to disrupt services" python script that packs quite a punch

maldev.cpp <=> a skeleton cpp slave code that connects to its master with (any) requested info 

malPy <=> the python counterpart of maldev but with much more features now, and hopefully soon
